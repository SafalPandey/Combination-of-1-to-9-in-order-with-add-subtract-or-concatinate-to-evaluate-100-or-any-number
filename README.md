# Combination-of-1-to-9-in-some-order-to-evaluate-100-or-any-number

A simple JS program to figure out the possible combinations of 1 to 9 and +, - or concatination to get the evaluated result of 100 or another number provided by the user.

I got this problem in a test and found it interesting to solve.

NOTE: For user input you will require Node "readline" module to be installed. Use <code> npm install -g readline </code>
