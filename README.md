# Combination-of-1-to-9-in-some-order-to-evaluate-100-or-any-number

A simple JS program to figure out the possible combinations of 1 to 9 and +, - or concatination to get the evaluated result of 100 or another number provided by the user.
For Eg: '1+2+3-4+5+6+78+9' = 100
I got this problem in a test and found it interesting.

NOTE: For user input you will need Node "readline" module to be installed. Use 
      <code> npm install -g readline </code>
      eval() could not be run in browser due to memory overflow error.
